A hackathon project by the Georgia Tech delegation to #BYND2015

This project was done by Alex Stelea, Deana Brown, Nekabari Goka, and Amanda Meng to present at the BYND2015 Global Youth Summit hackathon. 

It represents an idea that governments should have open access to primary school completion rate information and see how various policies impact different countries around the world in improving the completion rate for primary school students.
